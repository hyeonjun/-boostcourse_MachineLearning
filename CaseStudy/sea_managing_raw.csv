US,US,P,A1,SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT,"Waste water conditioning has nearly 150 years of history. During this time, a method has developed that is considered to be state of the art. While this method meets the requirements at hand, it is complicated and expensive. The novel method breaks down the rigidly entrenched method and simplifies it. In a plurality of stages, the only energy that is used is gravity, which is readily available and free of cost. Thus, an “alternative sewage treatment plant” has been developed, which has a simpler method and is less expensive in terms of investment costs and operating costs, at the same capacity, and requires only a fraction of the previous required surface area. The most important characteristic of the invention is that the novel method separates solids from waste water immediately after entering the sewage treatment plant. Mechanically purified water is much faster, easier and less expensive to purify. The paths pursued for conditioning of the sludge are also new. The sludge is regarded as an energy source or recyclable material, which should be utilized accordingly. According to the invention, the prerequisite for utilizing the sludge is also created by economically drying it to 95 to 98% dry substance.","1.

US,US,P,B1,Industrial waste water treatment process,"A process for the treatment of industrial waste water. The process includes the steps of admixing partially-treated waste water containing precipitated impurities with a flocculating agent in a flocculation basin, directing the admixed waste water to an elongated sedimentation basin, allowing flocculated solids in the waste water to settle to the bottom of the sedimentation basin, removing the settled solids from the bottom of the sedimentation basin and directing the treated water from the sedimentation basin.

The warmed actively digesting sludge is pumped from the slipstream loop through a rock trap into a delivery/input loop both for aiding transport or delivery of FOG waste to, and for partially filing a closed receiving/conditioning holding tank, where the warmed actively digesting sludge softens and liquefies the FOG wastes offloaded into the holding tank for further treatment at a desired treatment temperature range (whether psychrophilic, mesophilic, or thermophilic).

US,US,P,A1,Method and apparatus for using peroxide and alkali to recover bitumen from tar sands,"Method and apparatus for treating an ore comprising mineral substrate particles surrounded by hydrocarbon compounds, especially tar sand grains, process tailings, and contaminated soils, to recover a hydrocarbon portion and a cleaned substrate portion. In a preferably continuous process, hydrocarbonaceous rock, sand, ore, tailings, or soil containing bitumen, petroleum, and/or kerogen may be crushed or otherwise comminuted as needed to provide a particle size of sand or smaller. The ore is mixed with water to form a slurry, which may also contain alkali, for example, sodium hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate. The slurry is heated to about 80° C. and is intensively sheared to condition the slurry for separation, preferably by shear-fracture of the hydrocarbon layers surrounding the particles in the grains. The conditioned slurry is blended with a peroxide in aqueous solution, preferably hydrogen peroxide, which enters the grains and is decomposed therein, creating bubbles of free oxygen within the grains which disrupt the hydrocarbon envelope. In decomposing, the peroxide increases the hydrophilicity of the particle surfaces. Both free and bound hydrocarbons in the ore are thereby released from the mineral substrate particles. The resulting hydrocarbon globules are separated from the substrate particles by flotation, accelerated by attached oxygen bubbles. Alkali and/or peroxide may be added during the flotation process. Water and mineral tailings from the process are substantially free of hydrocarbon contamination and are environmentally suitable for landfill disposal. ","1.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester.

The wider is the solar heat receiver, the more solar power is available for conversion. The wider is the sail of the boat, the more wind is available to push the boat. Wherefore, the wideface solar trap made up of multi-layer transparent roofs covering a heat insulated box is used to heat up a radiator tubings that contain water. The multilayer transparent roof, having spaces in between sheets, prevents solar heat from backing out hence the trap becomes hoter and hoter because the inner sheet is not in contact with the cold wind.

US,US,P,A ,Flexible ocean upwelling pipe,"In an ocean thermal energy conversion facility, a cold water riser pipe is releasably supported at its upper end by the hull of the floating facility. The pipe is substantially vertical and has its lower end far below the hull above the ocean floor. The pipe is defined essentially entirely of a material which has a modulus of elasticity substantially less than that of steel, e.g., high density polyethylene, so that the pipe is flexible and compliant to rather than resistant to applied bending moments. The position of the lower end of the pipe relative to the hull is stabilized by a weight suspended below the lower end of the pipe on a flexible line. The pipe, apart from the weight, is positively buoyant. If support of the upper end of the pipe is released, the pipe sinks to the ocean floor, but is not damaged as the length of the line between the pipe and the weight is sufficient to allow the buoyant pipe to come to a stop within the line length after the weight contacts the ocean floor, and thereafter to float submerged above the ocean floor while moored to the ocean floor by the weight. The upper end of the pipe, while supported by the hull, communicates to a sump in the hull in which the water level is maintained below the ambient water level. The sump volume is sufficient to keep the pipe full during heaving of the hull, thereby preventing collapse of the pipe.","1.

US,US,P,A1,SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT,"Waste water conditioning has nearly 150 years of history. During this time, a method has developed that is considered to be state of the art. While this method meets the requirements at hand, it is complicated and expensive. The novel method breaks down the rigidly entrenched method and simplifies it. In a plurality of stages, the only energy that is used is gravity, which is readily available and free of cost. Thus, an “alternative sewage treatment plant” has been developed, which has a simpler method and is less expensive in terms of investment costs and operating costs, at the same capacity, and requires only a fraction of the previous required surface area. The most important characteristic of the invention is that the novel method separates solids from waste water immediately after entering the sewage treatment plant. Mechanically purified water is much faster, easier and less expensive to purify. The paths pursued for conditioning of the sludge are also new. The sludge is regarded as an energy source or recyclable material, which should be utilized accordingly.

US,US,P,A1,"Density adjustment by the use of light cycle oil, (LCO), for recovery and reclamation of spilled oil following the 2010 off-shore leak in the Gulf","Our idea is a new procedure that can be used to clean up and recover oil from spills or oil leaking from damaged ships or rigs. The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock. Furthermore, this idea can prevent the need for landfill storage and offset the cost of recovery.","1. Claim # 2 for application Ser. No. 12/803,127. I have developed a method to clean up and recover any gulf oil spills using the following steps. 1. Adjust the density of spilled oil by adding light cycle oil (LCO) to reduce the density below 0.96 g/ml on a densitometer.2. Collect the adjusted oil, including tar balls, in a shipping container.3. Drain the separated water layer which contains only 1.5 to 2.5 ppm oil.4. Transfer and sell the collected mixed oil to a refinery to be used as feedstock to reduce the cost of recovery.5.

The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock.

The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well. If the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too rapid, air will be entrained from the atmosphere into the gas-permeable conductive layer.

US,US,P,A1,Landfill design and method for improved landfill gas capture,"The invention provides an improved method of collecting biogas from a landfill that results in more complete collection of biogas produced in the landfill, and with less contamination with air. The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well. If the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too rapid, air will be entrained from the atmosphere into the gas-permeable conductive layer. But if the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too slow, biogas may percolate through the gas-containment layer and the surface of the landfill to escape. Monitoring the gas composition of the gas-permeable layer allows one to determine quickly and continuously whether the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too fast or too slow. ","1. A method of collecting biogas from a landfill having waste and an outer surface contacting the atmosphere, wherein  the landfill contains (i) at or near the outer surface contacting the atmosphere a gas-containment layer that has low gas permeability; and (ii) a gas-permeable layer toward the interior of the landfill from the gas-containment layer and toward the exterior of most of the landfill waste mass, the gas-permeable layer having at least 10-fold the gas-permeability of the gas-containment layer; the method comprising: (a) collecting biogas from the landfill from a location toward the interior of the landfill from the gas-permeable layer with at least one gas-collection well that collects biogas from an extraction location toward the interior of the landfill from the gas-permeable layer and separated by waste from the gas-permeable layer and draws it to the surface, the well comprising a biogas-collecting wellhead at the extraction location and a gas-impermeable conduit linking the wellhead to the surface to draw biogas from the wellhead to the surface; wherein if any biogas is collected directly from the gas permeable layer, it is less than 10% of the volume of biogas collected from the landfill from the extarction location toward the interior of the landfill through the at least one gas-collection well.

US,US,P,A1,Water treatment/remediation system,"[none] A treatment system passes feed water containing a contaminant such as perchlorate through a bed of strong base anion exchange resin that has been placed in a form (e.g., in sulfate form) to selectively capture the contaminant while passing other ions (e.g., nitrate) that may also be present in the water. The bed selectively removes the perchlorate with high efficiency, for example on a stoichiometric basis, until exhaustion. The bed operates robustly without spiking or displacement of more weakly-held or lower affinity ions as composition of the feed varies. The water may be further treated, if necessary, to produce a purified or potable product, in which case downstream processes may remove remaining contaminants and co-ions. Alternatively, the treated stream may be returned to or blended with the source to effect contaminant remediation, e.g., site clean-up. Contaminants such as uranium species, perchlorate or pertechnate may be treated by this method using ordinary (non-specialty) exchange resins. The bed may include a carousel, and the exhausted upstream portion of the resin may efficiently be disposed of by incineration, or may be rotated out for regeneration. Alternatively, the bed or the spent portion thereof may be periodically regenerated transferring perchlorate to a regeneration fluid waste. The concentrated waste may be disposed of by incineration, bioreaction or other suitable disposal process. The concentrated regen waste may also be passed through a smaller, sacrificial bed of ion exchange resin to capture its perchlorate, allowing re-use of the regen fluid and forming a lower-volume solid waste output. This second-bed re-transfer process operates efficiently at the high concentration present in spent regen fluid, and requires only a small fraction of the original bed volume. ","1.

US,US,P,A1,Method and apparatus for separating bitumen from particulate substrates,"Method and apparatus for treating an ore comprising mineral substrate particles surrounded by hydrocarbon compounds, especially tar sand grains and contaminated soils, to recover a hydrocarbon portion and a cleaned substrate portion. In a preferably continuous process, hydrocarbonaceous rock, sand, ore, or soil containing bitumen, petroleum, and/or kerogen may be crushed or otherwise comminuted as needed to provide a particle size of sand or smaller. The ore is mixed with water to form a slurry. The slurry is heated to about 80° C. and is intensively sheared to condition the slurry for separation, preferably by shear-fracture of the hydrocarbon layers surrounding the particles in the grains. The conditioned slurry is blended with a peroxide in aqueous solution, preferably hydrogen peroxide, which enters the grains and is decomposed therein, creating bubbles of free oxygen within the grains which disrupt the hydrocarbon envelope. In decomposing, the peroxide increases the hydrophilicity of the particle surfaces. Both free and bound hydrocarbons in the ore are thereby released from the mineral substrate particles. The resulting hydrocarbon globules are separated from the substrate particles by flotation, accelerated by attached oxygen bubbles. Water and mineral tailings from the process are substantially free of hydrocarbon contamination and are environmentally suitable for landfill disposal. ","1. A method for separating bitumen material from mineral particulates in grains of a hydrocarbonaceous ore, comprising the steps of: a) mixing said ore with water to form an aqueous slurry of said grains; b) tempering said slurry to a temperature between about 20° C. and 150° C.; c) shearing said slurry for at least one minute; d) adding a peroxide to said slurry; e) forming oxygen bubbles between said bitumen material and said mineral particulates within said grains by decomposing a portion of said peroxide therein; and f) separating said bitumen material from said mineral particulates.

US,US,P,A1,Pcb treating device and pcb treating method by electrolysis,"Toxic PCB has been broadly used as insulating oil in electric equipment such as capacitors, transformers and the like. Since the PCB is a refractory organic compound, the disposal of PCB is not advanced until now. This is a great social problem in Japan and the world. Thus, the early disposal of PCB is demanded. The conventional PCB disposing systems include a burnout type high-temperature disposing system and a chemical decomposing system. However, the high-temperature burning system is not satisfactorily improved due to various problems such as a difficulty of control for a furnace, a problem of disposing the ash containing non-decomposed PCB, a problem of generation of dioxin in lower processing temperature, a problem of movement of the PCB and a problem of not obtaining the agreement of inhabitants. Moreover, the chemical decomposing system raises various other problems in that a plant must be constructed with a huge investment that is said to be equal to 40 hundred millions per plant, that PCB must be transported to the PCB disposing plant and that the PCB disposing speed in the plan is too slow. The present invention provides a novel PCB electrolyzing and disposing method and apparatus based on a new idea in which the PCB used as electrically insulating oil can be electrolyzed by passing the electricity through the PCB. The PCB disposing apparatus of the present invention may be portable. Thus, the apparatus can be moved to any PCB storage place to dispose the PCB in place without transportation of the PCB. In addition to the introduction of the PCB into an electrolyzing tank, the PCB may be electrolyzed by pouring water into the container of equipment containing the remaining PCB, inserting the inserting portion including the electric-wave rod, electrode rods and others into the water to electrolyze the PCB. A PCB-polluted container may be placed in a large-sized disposing tank for electrolysis.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester.

The leakage of oil at such depth in sea is hard to assess. In such cases controlling and collection of the spill is the first thing to do. The Espriz Funnel system is based on simple and logical principles and the operation is low cost and fast.

The loaded fuel may be accompanied by sea water and separating is easy to do. By this method the contact between the leaked oil and the sea water will be reduced to minimum possible and practically the whole leaked oil will be collected, without contaminating the sea water.

A storage area is accessed by automated guided vehicles which receive and unload containerized loads. On the waterside, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and ships using quay cranes. On the ground transportation side, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and truck or rail carriers using semi automated or automated remote-controlled bridge cranes. Within the storage area, loads are exchanged between the vehicles and the storage facilities using automated stacking cranes. The vehicles are adapted to receive a cassette storage platform which in turn receives standard ISO containers. The vehicles also are adapted to receive one or more alternative platforms including a coning platform for workers to manage container coning, a reefer access and maintenance platform, and a worker transport platform. The use of a single vehicle type with interchangeable platforms allows for maximum flexibility and efficiency. The automation of the vehicle allows for complete contamination within the storage portion of the system. The system thus substantially extends the reach of automation to cover both landside and waterside intra-terminal transfer operations. By this extension, the interface of workers and machines is greatly reduced, increasing safety, productivity, security, and capacity. By this extension, the robotic control process can be fully optimized, increasing velocity and reliability while reducing the terminal's environmental footprint.","1.

In particular, the present invention relates to a method of reducing such growth and the removal from the underside of yachts, boats and the like. In general, the present invention relates to anti-fouling systems as are known to prevent biological growth such as algae, seaweed and crustacea on marine vessels or underwater structures. Coating materials have been developed preventing corrosion due to oxidation of the surface of the structure. Although such materials have effects of retarding growth of the corrosion, however, they contain zinc, lead, copper, etc, raising a problem of environmental pollution due to dissolution of these metals into seawater. In addition, none of these coating materials can prevent clinging of marine organisms, and if they cling to the structure, oxidation is accelerated by oxygen sent out from the marine organisms, causing further growth of the corrosion of the structure. The formation of encrustations of barnacles, tunicates, and like fouling organisms, will increase the vessel's weight, thereby decreasing the available storage space, slow a vessel underway, increase its fuel consumption, and make it difficult to handle, thus reducing the vessel's performance and efficiency. The present invention addresses this need wherein the transducer is operable on a cyclic basis.","1.

US,US,P,A1,LOW-DRAG HYDRODYNAMIC SURFACES,"The invention relates to the use of gas cavities to reduce frictional drag on underwater surfaces such as hydrofoils, struts, fins, rudders, keels, propeller blades, ship hulls, underwater bodies, and wetted surfaces in general. Each gas-filled cavity is formed behind a discontinuity in the surface that causes the water boundary layer to separate from the surface. Gas is ejected into a region behind the discontinuity to fill the cavity; the gas can be air. If a cavity is open to the atmosphere, then air can typically fill the cavity naturally without air ejection. Cavities can either be closed or open. A low drag hydrofoil may have a closed cavity on one side, and an open cavity on the other side. For closed cavities, the underlying surface can be shaped to minimize cavity closure drag. Various ways to generate cavities, change hydrodynamic forces, and duct gas internally on hydrofoils and struts with cavities are covered.

US,US,P,B1,Phosphate mineral-based reactive barrier containment system,"A phosphate mineral based reactive barrier system. Phosphate minerals are known to be sinks for heavy metal contaminants. The reactive barrier prevents the release of contaminants from waste materials, sediments or dredged materials via reaction with the contaminants at the interface between the barrier and the waste material, sediments or dredged material. The barrier is comprised of a phosphate mineral material where the form of the phosphate mineral is variable but primarily insoluble. This barrier is placed below, around, and/or on top of the contaminated materials such that the contaminated materials are completely enveloped, capped, or contained by a grout curtain. The barrier can be in a (i) slurry form, (ii) blended matrix form with other inorganic agents, or (iii) composite form with a geotextile or geofabric. These methods of construction can be used singly or jointly. In some cases, pH control may be used to optimize the chemical reactions within the barrier system. The barrier mechanism relies on the phenomena of adsorption, surface precipitation and co-precipitation of metal phosphate surface precipitates to chemically retard diffusion from the waste material.

The reclamation is accomplished by restoring the oil's light density. This is accomplished with density control by adding light cycle oil, (LCO), with a density of 0.82 g/ml, to the oil being recovered for the purpose of reprocessing in refineries. Recovery is made possible through the application of solubility rules found in organic chemistry. LCO is a mixture of many different molecular weight hydrocarbons that have many different numbers of carbons in their chains, branches, or rings. Each of these hydrocarbons dissolves a small part of the oil preparing the mixture for collection and reprocessing as refinery feedstock.

The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well.

It uses double-cone devices (102, 116, 125) as pressure amplifiers which due to their lack of moving parts avoid the risk of additional contamination of the well and provide a prolonged lifetime.

US,US,P,A1,Landfill design and method for improved landfill gas capture,"The invention provides an improved method of collecting biogas from a landfill that results in more complete collection of biogas produced in the landfill, and with less contamination with air. The method involves providing the landfill with an upper gas containment layer near the surface of the landfill to retard biogas escape and air entrainment into the landfill. Underneath the gas containment layer is provided a gas-permeable conductive layer. Underneath the conductive layer, a well withdraws biogas from the landfill. Withdrawal of biogas from the well creates a partial vacuum that draws gas from the gas-permeable conductive layer down through the waste mass to the well. If the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too rapid, air will be entrained from the atmosphere into the gas-permeable conductive layer. But if the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too slow, biogas may percolate through the gas-containment layer and the surface of the landfill to escape. Monitoring the gas composition of the gas-permeable layer allows one to determine quickly and continuously whether the rate of gas withdrawal from the well is too fast or too slow. ","1.

US,US,P,A1,Water treatment/remediation system,"[none] A treatment system passes feed water containing a contaminant such as perchlorate through a bed of strong base anion exchange resin that has been placed in a form (e.g., in sulfate form) to selectively capture the contaminant while passing other ions (e.g., nitrate) that may also be present in the water. The bed selectively removes the perchlorate with high efficiency, for example on a stoichiometric basis, until exhaustion. The bed operates robustly without spiking or displacement of more weakly-held or lower affinity ions as composition of the feed varies. The water may be further treated, if necessary, to produce a purified or potable product, in which case downstream processes may remove remaining contaminants and co-ions. Alternatively, the treated stream may be returned to or blended with the source to effect contaminant remediation, e.g., site clean-up. Contaminants such as uranium species, perchlorate or pertechnate may be treated by this method using ordinary (non-specialty) exchange resins. The bed may include a carousel, and the exhausted upstream portion of the resin may efficiently be disposed of by incineration, or may be rotated out for regeneration. Alternatively, the bed or the spent portion thereof may be periodically regenerated transferring perchlorate to a regeneration fluid waste. The concentrated waste may be disposed of by incineration, bioreaction or other suitable disposal process. The concentrated regen waste may also be passed through a smaller, sacrificial bed of ion exchange resin to capture its perchlorate, allowing re-use of the regen fluid and forming a lower-volume solid waste output. This second-bed re-transfer process operates efficiently at the high concentration present in spent regen fluid, and requires only a small fraction of the original bed volume. ","1.

US,US,P,A1,Pcb treating device and pcb treating method by electrolysis,"Toxic PCB has been broadly used as insulating oil in electric equipment such as capacitors, transformers and the like. Since the PCB is a refractory organic compound, the disposal of PCB is not advanced until now. This is a great social problem in Japan and the world. Thus, the early disposal of PCB is demanded. The conventional PCB disposing systems include a burnout type high-temperature disposing system and a chemical decomposing system. However, the high-temperature burning system is not satisfactorily improved due to various problems such as a difficulty of control for a furnace, a problem of disposing the ash containing non-decomposed PCB, a problem of generation of dioxin in lower processing temperature, a problem of movement of the PCB and a problem of not obtaining the agreement of inhabitants. Moreover, the chemical decomposing system raises various other problems in that a plant must be constructed with a huge investment that is said to be equal to 40 hundred millions per plant, that PCB must be transported to the PCB disposing plant and that the PCB disposing speed in the plan is too slow.

US,US,P,B1,Phosphate mineral-based reactive barrier containment system,"A phosphate mineral based reactive barrier system. Phosphate minerals are known to be sinks for heavy metal contaminants. The reactive barrier prevents the release of contaminants from waste materials, sediments or dredged materials via reaction with the contaminants at the interface between the barrier and the waste material, sediments or dredged material. The barrier is comprised of a phosphate mineral material where the form of the phosphate mineral is variable but primarily insoluble. This barrier is placed below, around, and/or on top of the contaminated materials such that the contaminated materials are completely enveloped, capped, or contained by a grout curtain. The barrier can be in a (i) slurry form, (ii) blended matrix form with other inorganic agents, or (iii) composite form with a geotextile or geofabric. These methods of construction can be used singly or jointly. In some cases, pH control may be used to optimize the chemical reactions within the barrier system. The barrier mechanism relies on the phenomena of adsorption, surface precipitation and co-precipitation of metal phosphate surface precipitates to chemically retard diffusion from the waste material. Immobilization may also occur secondarily when a small percentage of the phosphate minerals partially dissolve and the phosphate precipitates with metals to form metal phosphate precipitates in the pore water system of the reactive barrier. The contaminated wastes, sediments or dredged materials may have been subjected to solidification or chemical stabilization or other forms of treatment prior to disposal.","1.

All that is needed is intimate contact between the fish bones and fish hard parts and the contaminated waste form, soil particles, or water. In a system of, for example, soil, waste, groundwater, surface water, waste streams, or the digestive tracts of animals, the presence of fish bones and fish hard parts reduces the amount of metal that can mobilize and migrate out of the system. Fish bones and fish hard parts remove metals from waters passing through the system or originating within the system. Fish bones and fish hard parts reduce the bioavailability of metals to organisms coming into contact with the system and from water leaving the system.

A floating check valve is connected to each of the drain pipes to regulate the flow of water through the drain pipe. The floating check valve includes a valve element that has a density which causes the valve element to float in water and sink in oil. Therefore, when the valve element is surrounded by oil, the drain pipe will close and impede the passage of oil through the drain pipe.

US,US,P,A ,Pre-thickened aerobic digester system,"An aerobic treatment process is operated to reduce overall oxygen requirements, to maintain general pH balance and to produce a low-coliform solids effluent. From the system's clarifier a slurry of concentrated solids is moved to a premix basin, where the slurry is vigorously aerated for a sufficient time to raise microbial activity and dissolved oxygen content. The aerated, microbially active sludge is then moved to a gravity thickener basin, in which solids are allowed to settle to the bottom without aeration, to establish a quiescent state in the settled sludge and also an anoxic stage. This causes the sludge to be denitrified by microbial action, raising and stabilizing the pH of the sludge. Separated supernatant liquid is decanted and removed from the gravity thickener. The sludge is moved into an aerobic digester, where the sludge is aerated and nitrification occurs but using less aeration than normally required in a digester, due to the effect of anoxic/aerobic phases. A portion of the slurry in the aerobic digester basin is recycled back to the premix basin. Another important aspect is the use of two digesters, only one in loop with the premix and thickener at any one time, with each digester being taken out of the loop and isolated when a solids content of about 25,000 to 35,000 mg/L (21/2% to 3.5%) is achieved in that digester. The isolation results in a significantly lowered coliform content in the effluent sludge.","1.
